# Contributing to Mithridatium

Thank you for checking out **Mithridatium**! We are excited to have you here. This project is focused on building a framework to **verify the integrity of pretrained AI models** by detecting backdoors and data poisoning. If you are interested in contributing, below are some guidelines to help us make the most out of your contribution.

## Contribution Scope

⚠️ **Note:**

- Issues labeled **`internal team`** are reserved for the project’s assigned developers and will not be accepted from outside contributors.
- Once the framework is stable, we will open up selected issues for external contributors with labels such as **`good first issue`** or **`help wanted`**.

We encourage you to watch this repository if you’d like to stay updated!

## Issue Labels

We use labels to organize contributions:

- **`internal team`** – restricted to the internal project developers.
- **`bug`**, **`enhancement`**, **`documentation`** – for categorizing tasks.
- In the future: **`good first issue`** and **`help wanted`** will indicate tasks that are open to the community.
