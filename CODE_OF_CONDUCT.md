## Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of Mithridatium, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,

- level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,

- or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an environment where all participants feel respected, valued, and empowered to contribute.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

- Showing empathy toward other community members

- Recognizing that collaboration is more valuable than competition

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention

- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments and personal attacks

- Public or private harassment

- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission

- Any behavior that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing community standards.
They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:

- comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and pull requests that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct,

- or temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub issues, pull requests, documentation, and discussions)
and in public spaces when an individual represents the project or its community.

Examples of representing the project include using an official project e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers at:

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
